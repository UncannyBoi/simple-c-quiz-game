# Simple C Quiz Game
A simple quiz game made with C, intended for C programming beginners!


This is a CLI quiz program made with C. It features basic
option selection, input error handling, and a simple randomization.

An executable for windows can be found in the releases tab if you so wish to try it.


NOTE: This is a personal and an academic project I made with the intention of practicing
my programming skills. It is in no way perfect or has good implementations of logic! Matter of fact,
the questions are hardcoded and not flexible at all!


Features I want to add soon:

1. Flexible function def using a different file
2. Flexible question and answers creation
3. GUI version of the game
4. Automated Building of an executable
